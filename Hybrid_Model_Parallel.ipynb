        "This code defines a multi-task learning model for text classification, leveraging both GPT-2 and DistilBERT base models. It uses a fusion module to combine features from both models with cross-attention and a fusion gate. The model performs three tasks: intent classification, category classification, and named entity recognition (NER). It includes separate fusion and attention mechanisms for each task, followed by classification heads to generate predictions. The model also supports loss computation if labels for all tasks are provided, enabling joint training across multiple tasks. In the code, the parameters of the base models (GPT-2 and DistilBERT) are frozen to prevent their weights from being updated during training. This is done by setting requires_grad = False for all parameters of both models, ensuring that only the task-specific components, such as the FusionModule, attention layers, and classification heads, are trained."
